# RFPS-AIMMD
Rejection free path sampling by AI for discovering mechanism of molecular dynamics. My internship in FIAS supervised by Prof. Covino, Roberto and Gianmarco Lazzeri.
This implementation is based on the RFPS algorithm developed by Gianmarco Lazzeri during his PhD, under the supervision of Dr. Roberto Covino.  
I revised and extended the method during my internship at FIAS. This code reflects my understanding and implementation of the RFPS procedure.
